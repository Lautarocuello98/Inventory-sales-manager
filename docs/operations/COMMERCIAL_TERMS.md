# Commercial Terms

This repository remains MIT-licensed for source reference and internal use. Customer distribution is governed by a commercial agreement (MSA/EULA + Order Form + DPA when required).

## Contract package (minimum)
- **Order Form**: customer name, seats/sites, term, pricing, billing cycle, taxes.
- **EULA/MSA**: license grant, restrictions, warranties, liability cap, termination.
- **Support addendum**: links to SLA and incident process.
- **Data processing addendum (DPA)**: only when customer policy or regulation requires it.

## Commercial policy
- License metric: per-seat or per-site, explicitly defined per Order Form.
- Contract term: 12 months default, auto-renewal unless canceled 30 days before renewal.
- Payment terms: net 15 (or agreed in Order Form).
- Support scope: standard support through official channels in business hours.
- Liability model: limited liability and exclusion of indirect/consequential damages.

## Required operational references
- Support and incident process: `docs/operations/SUPPORT_SLA_AND_INCIDENTS.md`.
- Release and rollback process: `docs/release/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`.
- Update channel metadata: `release/latest.json`.

## Go-to-market checklist
- [x] EULA/MSA template defined and versioned.
- [x] SLA/incident policy documented.
- [x] Release + rollback process documented.
